# Question
[total-perspective-vortex] In the subject, page5, first paragraph, second sentence. 
https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/60845/en.subject.pdf

The data was measured during a motor imagery experiment, where people had to do or imagine a hand or feet movement.

I am wondering if what you meant was using only imagery data. 

The data was measured during a motor imagery experiment, where people had to imagine a hand or feet movement.
